# Take Home Test (React Native)

## Overview

This is a takehome test for candidates applying for a React Native developer
position at MoonPay. It contains two sections: "Mobile", and "Follow-up" which
together include a series of tests involving React Native, Styling, JavaScript.

Feel free to solve these questions however you see fit, using whatever coding
style or third-party libraries you think are appropriate.

For review purposes we'd recommend using Expo, but you don't have to use this if you don't want to.

To start the test, simply clone this repo and make your edits locally.

## Mobile

For the mobile portion of the test, use the `/mobile` folder. There are 7 features we'd like to add:

1. Fetch and display the list of currencies available on MoonPay (see endpoint below).
2. Add styles to create a responsive layout that will display one column on mobile
   devices and two columns on tablet devices.
3. Add a control to denote if currencies not supported in the US should be displayed.
4. Add a control to denote if currencies not available in test mode should be displayed.
5. Add a control of your choice to sort the list of currencies by alphabetical order using the name of the currencies.
6. Add a control of your choice to sort the list of currencies by alphabetical order using the symbol/code of the currencies.
7. Add a control of your choice to apply a random shuffle to the list of currencies when it is clicked.

Feel free to structure the code however you prefer and use third-party libraries at your discretion.

We are also interested to see how you would approach testing your code.

Do not spend too much time on making it beautiful. Basic aesthetics are welcome, but we are not
grading your design skills here.

### NOTE

React Native must be used as the base library and the application should work in both android and iOS devices

### API Information

- **MoonPay API `GET /v3/currencies` endpoint:** https://api.moonpay.com/v3/currencies

## Follow-up

Answer the questions in the [FOLLOW-UP.md](./FOLLOW-UP.md) file.

## Submitting Your Code

Once you've completed the test, please compress your files (via zip or tar) and
return them as a link or email attachment in reply to your test invite. We'd like the
code in your submission to remain private, so please avoid committing or pushing
the code publicly.

**Do not include node_modules or .git in your submission**

Once we receive it, a member of our team will review and we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

Thanks!
